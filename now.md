Welcome one, welcome all, to the inaugural Crash Now Page. I saw my friend Jack Grimes doing this and thought it was a cool idea, so I'm hopping on it too. I'm gonna roughly borrow Jack's format here cuz I think it's cool. You're reading the August 15, 2024 edition of this page. When it's gone, it's gone... at least until I have an archive up.

# Making 
I'm learning how to crochet because I really need something to do that keeps my mind busy and doesn't involve a screen. I can't be on the puter all the time! Plus it seems like crochet is the exact intersection between geeky stuff and funny little guys. I bought this little crochet mushroom guy from a booth at a local farmer's market and that really pushed me over the fence. 
Currently finishing up a little frog orb thing, then I'll try something like a whale or a Stardew Valley chicken. There's *SO* many Pokemon amigurumi patterns out there, I wanna try out this pattern to make a Goomy but it looks decently complicated. Maybe I'll do a Sanrio guy next, my sister loves Cinnamoroll and I love Pompompurin so making either of them would be fun. 

As I mentioned before, I'm also trying to write more! I keep coming back to this one Beastars fanfic idea I've had in my head ever since I read it over the pandemic, so like 4 years? It takes place after the ending of the manga, so I won't go into too much detail here, but if you're familiar with the manga and wanna hear the general premise, hit me up.

# Doing
I'm helping my mom and stepdad move, so there's a lot of unpacking to do. Enjoying life in this small little rural WI town, there's not a *huge* amount of stuff to do here but it's still nice. 

I've been doing some cooking and baking, and it's wild how much better homemade bread is than store-bought bread. Even the quick-bake bread machine recipes are really, really good. Everyone should go make one good loaf or boule of homemade bread if you have the time and the spoons.  

Gearing back up for the school year too. Picking up the pieces after a summer math class I needed to take fell through, through no fault of my own. I'm thinking of picking up a psych minor; I'll probably have to pick up humanities/social science courses to stay enrolled full-time, and this way it'll actually go towards something. Maybe a mechanical engineer with a psych minor will stand out on my resume. 
# Thinking 
I'm once again thinking about social media. My post-Twitter site of choice is Cohost, and it's run into some moderation controversy again. I don't know the entirety of the events so I'm not gonna summarize 'em, but it culminated in the staff updating the moderation guidelines to say "we're gonna be more transparent about what action was taken on reports, and we're codifying the 'you're being a shit-stirring asshole, get off our site' policy". 

Now, to clarify, I still intend on using Cohost, and I still believe in its mission and the staff's good intentions. That said: ultimately, they're trying to run a medium-size social media site with a one-person mod team. I'm very glad the staff listen to us users, but I think there's only so many times the cycle of "moderation issue occurs, it blows up across the site, staff put up an announcement and change policy" can repeat itself. 

On a semi-related note, I'm thinking I'll tentatively add Bluesky to my social media rotation. I see a lot of cool people and artists there, and I'm liking some of the moderation features I've seen. Jack Dorsey is gone and the founder of Techdirt's on their board now, so that gives me some hope Bluesky is insulated from the libertarian-tech-bro types. 

# Reading
I've had this book called *A Darker Shade of Magic* on my shelf for a while now, picked it up a few years ago because the alternate-universe London thing vaguely reminded me of *Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers*, which I'd just finished at the time. I like it so far, but I really gotta dedicate more time to actually reading through it.

I recently caught up on *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: The Jojolands*. I'm a sucker for weird superpowers, and Araki is going nuts with the Stands this time. I just wish the scanlation I was reading didn't put every proper noun in **'bold and quotes'** though. 

On my radar: *The Expanse* books, thanks to Jack and Texas Sam. They sound cool, but they've always put me off a bit because they're just so huge. I saw someone in high school reading *Leviathan Wakes* and that thing was a freakin' *tome*. They apparently rule so much though, so I really should pick 'em up. 

# Listening
Machine Girl's latest single goes *SO* hard. The way *SUPER FREQ* and *Until I Die* have been sonically similar to *Neon White*/*RePorpoised Phantasies* but with the hardcore vocals of *Because I'm Young* hits my brain in just the right way. If this is what the new album is gonna be like, it's gonna be an instant 10/10 from me. I gotta get tix to see em in Madison in December. 

I've listened to *SMILE! :D* by Porter Robinson once during the Spotify listening party he ran, I liked it! I think I'll have to re-listen to it on my own to really Get It though. Nurture's still my favorite album from him, but it's really interesting to see him move from "this is how fame has affected me and my self-image" in Nurture to "this is how I see fame and its impact on other people" in Smile. He's said that this is his last word on the theme of fame, which is a good move. There's only so many times you can go over your thoughts on one theme, and he's covered both sides of the coin here. 

On my radar: *Flight b741* by King Gizz, *nothing* by Louis Cole, *To My Chagrin* by Mechanical Canine. My sister really wants to see Femtanyl at the X-Ray Arcade in a few weeks, and I like the few songs I've heard from them, so I'll have to listen to em more. 
# Playing 

My sister ended up getting a PS3 for 10 bucks at a garage sale and modding it, so I've been playing some *Wipeout HD Fury* with her. It's probably one of my favorite racing games, and it still looks fantastic 16 years after release. Piloting my beloved Goteki 45 ship through the aquatic tunnels of Vineta K always feels so good. 

I've also been going hard on *Deep Rock Galactic* lately. I'm thoroughly convinced it's the best co-op game since *Left 4 Dead 2*. It's good with randoms, but even better when you're locked the fuck in with your friends. In this day and age of live service and battle passes, it's nice to see a game that's not built around FOMO and actually embraces mods. Rock and stone to the bone. 

Finally, I'm replaying *Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance*. Even though the last time I played it was a few years ago, I think I'm way better at combat now. I'm also starting to think that the key to character action games isn't to memorize all the moves; rather, memorize the important combo-launching moves then just hit buttons to do shit. This story is still absolutely nuts. I'm no "omg guys Hideo Kojima predicted the future" guy, all good sci-fi is built off an extrapolation of current trends. Still, the "military industrial complex instigating a war to ruthlessly profiteer off of it" plot never ceases to be relevant.
